# C Programming Language

## Motivations

I learned C a long time ago when I first got started programming. After learning more about
compilers I decided to revisit the language and what an impact it's had on me. There is so many
wonderful intricacies to enjoy in this amazing lower level language.

## Topics

- Learning more pragmatic features of c that might get overlooked when using c academically for
  learning algorithms ect:
  - writing Makefiles
  - setting up a maintainable architecture
  - sharing functions across a codebase
  - testing in c (more complex than you might think. C programmers out there, you know what i'm
    talking about ;)
- Modern C - using C to build in a more careful way: memory safety, ownership, ect.
